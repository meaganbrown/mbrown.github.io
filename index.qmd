## Professional Bio

<h4>Professional Bio</h4>

I am a masters student graduating in June 2023 with a degree in [Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science). I am looking to use my passion for environmental justice and data science skills to make a difference in California. I love visualizing and solving problems using R and geographic information system software. I am especially interested in California's water resources, but open to other opportunities.

I gained skills in research, coding, and ArcGIS Pro during my undergraduate education. After graduating from UC Santa Barbara in 2021, I worked with The Nature Conservancy looking at California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. Additionally, I independently developed an interactive dashboard and survey using ArcGIS Online tools for the City of Santa Barbara's Sustainability & Resilience department.

Description: We are developing a [ShinyApp Dashboard](https://shiny.rstudio.com) in R to show wildfire statistics and trends within [groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/natural-resources/geology/groundwater/groundwater-dependent-ecosystems) in California. The final product will be similar to [this example](https://gde.codefornature.org/#/map) where you can click on any GDE in California and view wildfire statistics for that particular GDE.
