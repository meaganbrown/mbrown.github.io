## A Little About Me!

I am currently pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science Degree at UC Santa Barbara with the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I enjoy geospatial analysis and I am passionate about environmental justice and groundwater resources. In my spare time you can find me at the beach with my pup!
