## Professional Bio

<h4>Professional Bio</h4>

I am a masters student looking to use my passion for environmental justice and data science skills to make a difference in California after graduating in June 2023. I love visualizing and solving problems using R and geographic information system software. I am especially interested in California's water resources.

I gained skills in research, coding, and ArcGIS Pro during my undergraduate education. After graduating from UCSB in 2021, I worked with The Nature Conservancy looking at California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. Additionally, I independently developed an interactive dashboard and survey using ArcGIS Online tools for the City of Santa Barbara's Sustainability & Resilience department.
