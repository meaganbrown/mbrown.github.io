<h1>Personal Website</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

This is my [personal website](https://meaganbrown.github.io) that I made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/). I learned how to create this website in my [Masters of Environemntal Data Science program](https://ucsb-meds.github.io) and continute to make updates as I gain more experience. I also use this website as a way for me to practice other languages such as Java, HTML, and CSS that I may not use in my day to day work.
