    "text": "While there are extensive studies on how wildfires affect groundwater quality, there is minimal research on how groundwater availability influences wildfire severity (Paul et al. 2022). Specifically, this analysis has never been done in California where we are facing increasingly low groundwater levels due to over pumping and drought (Pauloo et al. 2020). After exploring CAL FIRE’s data, I found that from 1987 - 2018 the number of wildfires in Caifornia has been decreasing over time (Figure 1), however the intensity of fires has been increasing (Figure 2). Based on groundwater and plant interaction research, we know that there are ecosystems that are dependent on groundwater to survive (Meyers et al. 2021). My question is then – if groundwater levels are lower than usual due to over pumping and drought is this having an affect on the intensity of wildfires in California due to drier vegetation conditions?\n\n\nView Code\n#plotting fire occurences 1987 - 2018\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = ca_wildfire,\n            aes(x = year,\n                y = total_fires)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 12), name = \"Year\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma, name = \"Total Fires in California\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(caption = 'Figure 1.

    "text": "Data\n\nCAL FIRE - Wildland Fires & Acres - All Jurisdictions (1987 - 2018)\nFor the fire data used in my analysis, I used CAL FIRE’s Wildland Fires & Acres - All Jurisdictions (1987-2018) data. This data tells us the total number of fires and total acres burned in California across all jurisdictions. A limitation to this data is that it is in .pdf format so I had to manually input values into an excel spreadsheet. This could lead to human error in the transfer process.\n\n\nCalifornia DWR - Periodic Groundwater Level Measurements\nFor groundwater level data, I used the California Department of Water Resource’s periodic groundwater level measurement data. This data did not come with a data dictionary, so it was difficult to determine what each column name was abbreviated for in the data set. Luckily, I have a background in groundwater and was able to identify that the ‘gwe’ column stood for groundwater elevation."

    "text": "Results\nI began this analysis believing that lower groundwater elevation would result in an increase of acres burned in California. However, based on my box plot results (Figure 3) and my interaction model (Figure 4), I found that as groundwater elevation increases, there are more acres burned in California. With a correlation coefficient value of 0.41, there is a medium correlation between groundwater levels and total acres burned in California."

    "section": "Future Analysis",
    "text": "Future Analysis\nThe results of my analysis do not intuitively make sense to me because there should be less fuel for fire if plants have adequate hydration from groundwater. I believe further analysis is needed in order to come to a more reasonable conclusion on this topic. Due to limitations on the time frame of this project and the data used, I was only able to perform a generalized analysis across the entire state of California. To achieve more conclusive results it would be beneficial to look at specific California regions to see if there is a correlation between groundwater and wildfire severity. There is also spatial data available for California that could be used in spatial statistical analysis across the state to find if there is a relationship between groundwater and wildfire severity. Additional analysis could be conducted across other US states and compared to California’s results."

After conducting my senior thesis on equity and representation in California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), I discovered my enthusiasm for environmental justice and research.
