This data tells us the total number of fires and total acres burned in California across all jurisdictions. The limitation to this data was it was in .pdf format so I had to manually input values into an excel spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia DWR - Periodic Groundwater Level Measurements\nFor groundwater level data, I used the California Department of Water Resource’s periodic groundwater level measurement data."

    "text": "Hi, I’m Meagan! :)\nI am a first-generation graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Studies. Through my experience growing up near lakes with water quality problems due to agricultural runoff, I developed a passion for the environment. After conducting my senior thesis on equity and representation in California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) I discovered my passion for environmental justice and research. During my gap year, I worked for The Nature Conservancy and UCSB professor Dr. Debra Perrone, continuing my work in environmental justice with a focus on geospatial spatial analysis. I also interned for the City of Santa Barbara Sustainability & Resilience department developing an interactive dashboard for their webpage. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. My passions lie in water resources management, geospatial analysis, and environmental justice. With new skills from my Environmental Data Science degree, I will conduct research that benefits undeserved communities."
