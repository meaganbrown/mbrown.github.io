## Full Bio

<h4>Biography</h4>

I am a first-generation graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Studies. Through my experiences growing up near two lakes with water quality problems due to agricultural runoff, I developed a passion for the environment. After conducting my senior thesis on equity and representation in California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), I discovered my enthusiasm for environmental justice and research. During my gap year, I worked for The Nature Conservancy and UCSB professor Dr. Debra Perrone, continuing my environmental justice research with a focus on spatial analysis. I also interned for the City of Santa Barbara's Sustainability & Resilience department, where I developed an interactive dashboard for their webpage to show city clean up efforts over time. In June 2023, I graduated with a Master of Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. My interests lie in water resources management, spatial analysis, and environmental justice. With new skills from my Environmental Data Science degree, I am looking to apply my data science and research skills to benefit under-served communities.
